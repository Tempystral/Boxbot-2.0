# Boxbot 2.0
  A discord bot for a variety of things.

## Source Embedding ("Sauce")
  Boxbot replaces much of the functionality of SauceBot, and extends its features to include more websites. Components are maintained through extensions called "ladles".
### Ladles
- ### Pixiv
  - Posts and albums are embedded with a preview, up to 3 images max.
  - Ugoira does not work at this time (January 2020)
  - Note: this component is unfinished as of January 2020.
- ### Furaffinity
  - Explicit links are embedded with submission info and an image.
- ### e621/e926
  - Images directly linked from e621/e926 are sourced back to their original posts.
  - Links to pools are sourced with a description, and 3 preview images are embedded in Discord.
- ### Imgur
  - Multi-image albums are embedded with a description and previews.
  - Sound from Imgur videos does not work due to their unique implementation of webm.
- ### Planned Ladles
  - Inkbunny
  - Sadpanda/E-Hentai Galleries

## Threadwatcher
  - Boxbot automatically searches for 4chan threads according to tags you set. This feature is optional.
